Model codes for a N2PZD model with temperature sensitive growth, described by GP and R.

The key strength of this model is that metabolic processes that describe phytoplankton growth (i.e., GP and R) are represented seperately.

The following packages are essential to run the model code:

    'rTPC' https://padpadpadpad.github.io/rTPC/articles/rTPC.html ; for the thermal response curve
    'deSolve' https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html ; for the numerical integration
